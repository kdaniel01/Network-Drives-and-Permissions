Creating explicit permissions for users according to their role. As we can, Rick Henderson(Finance Manger) would have been able to access the Financial Assistant folder but access was configured to only grant Ben Jones(Financial Assistant) access which he only has read but no write access to this folder. This was done for all users and there respected folder. Mangers were granted full control of their folder which includes read and write functions.<br/>

We can see Rick only sees Finance Dept Folder and not HR Dept. Rick only can see the FInance Manager folder and not the Financial Assistant folder. Rick also created a new folder in the Finance Manager Folder called Budget but is not able to outside of that folder.<br />
